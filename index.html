    <p>
        I have chosen this movie to be my favorite because it is arguably one of the best Pirates of the Caribbean movie out of the whole series. It has action, romance, suspense, enchanting
         music, Epic fight scenes. Your most favorite pirate Jack Sparrow- sorry, Captain Jack Sparrow takes you over the seas to help his new friend save the woman he cares about deeply. Stops 
         some pirates from killing the woman and cures the pirates of their curse.   
    </p>
    <p>I'm not sure what else you could realy ask for</p>

    <h3>Cool Fight scene</h3>

    <p>Honestly My favorite is dead man's chest and at world's end, ok I love all of them, its hard to choose.</p>
